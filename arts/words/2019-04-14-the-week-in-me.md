A week for moving on, and staying the course.

## code

This week I wrote probably the last lines of new code for a Rails
app I've been working on for years. At this point our
conversations are about things like, well, how much would it cost to
just keep it running month-to-month? It's sad to say goodbye – the
team I'm on likes working together, and I think we were doing some
good – but it also feels right to move on.

And moving on has most of my energy right now. This week I've talked
with several people about potential projects, or just about maybe
working together on something someday. (BTW: [Hire me!][contact])
I ordered business cards, for
the first time since maybe 2008 (and that was for [my band][tin-cat]).
And I've been learning and trying new things.

New to me, anyway. Things like:

- [Gatsby,][gatsby] &ldquo;a tool for building progressive web apps that are
served as static assets&rdquo; (as per [Jason Lengstorf][lengstorf-quote]).
The tutorial was fun, and I contributed a few fixes for outdated links,
because, you know, if something's easy to fix, you should fix it.
- [Firebase][] and how to keep people from using your API key to
fill your database with spam. The best answer seems to be to allow
writes [only via serverless functions][firebase-functions]
that you define, instead of
allowing direct database access. Fair enough.
- [Callum Macrae's][macrae] talk on
[Accessibility with Vue][vue-accessibility] 
(or lack thereof) was informative and fun, and applies to
JavaScript-based user interfaces whether or not they use Vue.
- I happened upon [CoCreatz][], a coworking and community space in
St. Paul's nonprofit-saturated [Creative Enterprise Zone][]. It was a
nice place to spend an afternoon, and with hourly rates as well as
ongoing memberships, I plan to spend more afternoons there when I
find myself in St. Paul.       
- I also wrote about the blogs where I [find new things to learn about.][blogs]

One more thing: [RailsConf][] is *the* conference for
the web technology I've worked with consistently since 2007, and this
year it's in Minneapolis, an easy bike ride from my home... and today
I decided not to buy a ticket. I'm feeling weird
about it. I will be at [Minnebar][], though!  

## arts

Chipping away at [Five Fifths of Mary Poppins][poppins] with
[Oncoming Productions][oncoming]. We're rounding out our cast,
and we did a read-through of the script so far. We also started
working on an Oncoming Productions
web site, so I don't have to keep linking to the Facebook page.

[Bummertown][] – a tragicomic improv show for which I played background
music last fall – held auditions for our run [this summer at 
HUGE][bummertown-run]. As the show's accompanist, I got to watch
three rounds of auditions, each of them delightful, each in its
own way. I'm glad deciding who to cast isn't my job. 

I wrote a poem this week. I think it was okay!

## life

Last September at a [children's bookstore in Stockholm][bokslukaren] I
picked up
a book and fell in love with it – with the pictures, at least. I didn't
know any Swedish children, and I had no good reason to buy a children's
book in Swedish, so I put it back. But I did have a friend who was
expecting an American child, and I couldn't stop picturing myself
reading the book to that future child, in mispronounced Swedish and
mistranslated English, so a few days later I went back and bought it.

gorilla sitting at the patio table outside.][gorilla]

That child is now over three months old, and this week I finally started
translating Lena Sjöberg's [<cite>Natten lyser!</cite>][natten-lyser]. 
It's a book about things that light up in the night – from stars to
streetlights to bioluminescent bugs.

When I say "translating," I mean that I will spend a few seconds struggling
to place words I half-remember from the introductory Swedish course I took
last summer, then type a full sentence into [Microsoft Translator][], and
then use [tyda.se][] to investigate words that look a bit off, or that I'm
just curious about. It's going okay. I only have about two pages done,
but I've got time – this book is for readers aged 9 to 12.
