Ever feel like you're trying to do too many cool things with too many
cool people? And it's great but you'd just like to take a break to
wash the dishes, and write a blog post, and, like, sleep more?  

## arts

I've been doing lots of music and improv. Most of it's at
[HUGE Theater][huge]:

- [THE PAiNTERS][painters] just wrapped up a two-month run. It
  was very silly and it was great.
- [Bummertown] is still doing sad funny improv every Friday through August,
  with me supporting on electric guitar.
- This Sunday I'm accompanying [Bad Poets Society] on piano like a normal
  person. They do improvised scenes inspired by improvised poems.
- The two Sundays after that I'm in [I'm A Trio] at Improv A Go Go.
  Will and Gurayn and I play fantastical people with mundane problems,
  like a space gorgon who just can't get her shoelaces to stay tied.

Somewhere in between all of that, my duo [All the Books in the Library] 
managed to record a a song we both love, Wilco's "Radio Cure," for
a Theme Music tribute album. [Our version][Radio Cure] doesn't have the
uncanny radio ether of the original, but we did use a Pack 'n Play.
And the radio emissions of Saturn's moon.

And my next scripted play opens tomorrow! I've been working with
[Impossible Salt] on a funny, moving, mysterious, 
very loose, highly condensed adaptation of Ibsen's seven-hour Danish verse
play [Peer Gynt.][peer gynt]
The music I've been creating for it pulls in a little bit of
[Grieg] but also blues, jazz, and '70s softcore funk. It's the
first show for which I've been directed to "play something sexy."
There's also a sea chantey.

As always, check the [shows page] for details.

## code

Not much of my coding happens in public, but here are a few things
to share:

- I built a single-page app with the [Vuetify] framework. It was
  surprisingly easy to get a usable, decent-looking prototype together
  in a short period of time.
- Also, it was surprisingly hard to get authentication working.
  I'm curious now what other people use to get authentication out of
  the way and get on with the interesting parts of an application.
- I [wrote about Svelte,][Svelte] a modern web framework with some
  unique characteristics. I'm into it.
- I animated the Earth icon that pops into view when you scroll
  down on [ClimateChoice.co.][climatechoice]
  This is a tiny little thing but it
  makes me unreasonably happy. 
- I'm participating in the Impact Makers [Climate Fixathon.] You're
  welcome, planet. 



## life

You know what? You get it. All I'm going to say here is that I got
a hand blender and it's great. See you next "week."
