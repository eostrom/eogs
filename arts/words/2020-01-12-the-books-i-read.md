These are some of the books I most valued reading in 2019.

---

Anna Burns, <cite>[Milkman][].</cite> Confounding at first, but it can
teach you how to read it. I had finished a third of it
before I realized how invested I was, and maybe two thirds before I
noticed its dark sense of humor. It reminded me of <cite>1984</cite>
and <cite>Persepolis</cite>, both works about language, totalitarianism,
and thought control. This one is about Northern Ireland.    

Joshua Ferris, <cite>[Then We Came to the End][].</cite> This was a reread,
a little dated now
but I still love it. A comedic elegy to working in an ad agency around the turn
of this century, written mostly in second-person plural – so we get to know
individuals, but always within a "we" judging and speculating. One of my
all-time favorite final paragraphs, but don't bother skipping to the end –
it's about the journey. 

Sara Wachter-Boettcher, <cite>[Technically Wrong][].</cite> Best overview I've
read of technology, ethics, justice, and the trouble with algorithms.
Recommended to anyone who cares.

Erin Morgenstern, <cite>[The Night Circus][].</cite> I loved this novel so much
I don't want to talk about it. Not recommended.

## honorable mention

Elisabeth Åsbrink, <cite>[1947: Where Now Begins][1947].</cite> A mosaic, both
personal and historical, of a pivotal year.

Sarah Gailey, <cite>[Magic for Liars][].</cite> A deeply <i>noir</i> detective
novel set at a prep school for magical teenagers. Tore right through it.

Jon McGregor, <cite>[Reservoir 13][].</cite> A girl's gone missing, but it's
not a thriller. More concerned with the
rhythm and flow of the village than the mystery.

Kenneth Grahame, <cite>[The Wind in the Willows][].</cite> I remembered Mr. Toad
and his wild ride, via Disney, but did I ever understand how besotted with
nature this book is?
