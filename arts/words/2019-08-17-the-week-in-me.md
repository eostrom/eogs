Holy cow, it's only been about a week since my last weekly post.

## code

I've been a part-time/contract web developer for over a decade, but
this week I applied for a full-time job, for the third time this year.
It's a position doing work I'm interested in, on a product I use and
like, for a company that's been hiring smart, creative people I'd love
to work with. I finished the application late Wednesday evening, so
naturally my sleep that night was plagued by bad dreams about not
getting to
play with the cool kids.

Not to brag, but in waking life I am very lucky and I play with cool kids
on the regular. See the arts
section below, but also, I spent yesterday with my friend Matt working
on his very cool tech job site, [The Invisible Network.][TIN] Big
changes coming there soon.  

I'll also be playing with my cool friend Eric this Tuesday when we
host a [series of silly debates][Minnehour tweet] at Minnehour,
a happy hour for volunteers, community supporters, and sponsors
of [Minnestar.][Minnestar] There's probably still time for you
to become a sponsor or something, I don't know.

Speaking of cool, I really liked [this talk][Drasner Coldfront] by
[Sarah Drasner] at last year's [Coldfront conference.][Coldfront 2018]
The title is "The Future of Web Animation," but as I said on Twitter,
what it's really about is what's possible in web design, what could
become possible, and why we should imagine more.
   
## arts

We opened [Peer Gynt!][Peer Gynt] As I write this we're setting up for
the second of three performances on our our
second of three weekends. Sorry about all the math. What I'm saying is,
we're in the thick of it. It's going great.

[I'm A Trio] has its very first show at [HUGE] tomorrow night!
At a recent rehearsal, our coach told us that watching us warm up
was like reading a novel. So, if you like feeling like you're reading a novel
but you don't want to actually read one, please come to
[Improv A Go Go] this Sunday or next.

Only two more trips to [Bummertown!][Bummertown] At the show last night
I told a friend that my approach to scoring it was less about music, more
about a vague sense of unease. I was assured that I am nailing it. 

The [Oncoming Productions] web site now reflects the terrifying truth:
We're bringing back our Fringe hit Geminae for this fall's
[Twin Cities Horror Festival!][TCHF]

## life

Main thing is I took a home sleep test, for which I had to

- clip a device to the front of my nightshirt,
- strap it around my chest,
- strap another device to my belly,
- put my finger in a piece of flexible plastic,
- attach another device to my wrist with Velcro,
- put a plastic tube in each nostril,

and then somehow fall asleep. Proud to say I failed the test with flying
colors, and I hope soon to find out from my doctor what's ailing me.
