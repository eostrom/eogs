Here are the five songs I heard most in 2023.

1. "The Loneliest Time," Carly Rae Jepsen featuring Rufus Wainwright (2022)

This has happened to me more than once:

listen to the same Carly Rae Jepsen song for a week."

I read a quote from
Jepsen [on Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-loneliest-time/1637009231):

> This song is very much about that fantasy of going over to your ex's in the
> middle of the night and pouring rain to kindle what was not finished...
> It's just a terrible idea in real life, but it's really fun to sing about.

That self-awareness is what makes this a comedy song. I love this bit:

> Then you spoke the words to me  
> When you left – I still need to unpack it!  
> Let's save sorry for another night  
> 'Cause this time, love, we're gonna get it right

"I haven't tried to understand why we broke up, but never mind! This time for
sure!"

Also, it's catchy as hell. I wasn't even listening on repeat. I was asking
Siri to play "The Loneliest Time" by name, again and again and again.

2. "Famous," Jenn Champion (2023)

Jenn Champion started her recording career with a lo-fi bedroom record called
Sadstyle, all overdubbed electric guitar and angsty vocals
("Whatever you thought you saw in me that day, forget about it /
'Cause it's probably not there anymore"). I loved that album in all its
tinny vulnerable teenage pain, and told her so once at a Carissa's Wierd
show, but a couple of albums later she changed her name and I lost track of her.

Fast forward to this summer, when I somehow stumbled on her Kickstarter,
and this fall, when I cued up the new album for a first listen and started to
cry.
This song is all synths and banjo, but lyrically it's a direct line back to
those days – "just a kid in a goth club / didn't know how to feel love,"
through drugs and therapy and love and loss and... look, it's weird and
kind of condescending to feel proud of someone you don't even know, but
I'm just so proud of that sweet sad kid who grew up and made this record.

3. "Bird of Prey," Natalie Prass (2015)

I heard about this album from [James Rone](https://www.jamesrone.com/),
probably back when it happened; I still go through phases, as with CRJ above,
when I can't listen to anything else. I love her voice, I love her songs,
but more than anything I love the arrangements on this record, like
scraps of an ill-fated collaboration between Dusty Springfield in Memphis
and Philip Glass.

4. "Molly," Colton Ryan and Molly Gordon (2021)

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9vH6UKjEkvA?si=98tBlvkXdBMNO7S_" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Those arrangements also remind me of Burt Bacharach, a touchstone
of my musical evolution who died this February. He wrote
a new musical in his 90s! A new musical with melodies as catchy as
his hits from sixty years ago! This song is from 2021!

5. "Heptapod B," Jóhann Jóhannsson (2016)

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F0ahB25FJ6o?si=tx2Bs8LKz__ThRbT" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

From the motion picture <cite>Arrival</cite>. I mean, have you seen
this movie? Have you *heard* this movie? I don't understand how this music
was created and I hope I never figure it out.
