Over the years I've built a bunch of web sites for myself. When I was a
singer-songwriter, I built a site to showcase my songs. When I was
looking for tech work, I built a site to talk about programming. More
than once. (The web is littered with my past lives.)

And when I was looking for tech work, I hoped no one would
find my music sites, because if I'm an artist then maybe I'm frivolous and
not dedicated enough to do to work you need done. When I was making
music, I hoped no one would find my tech blogs, because
if you were moved by that song I wrote about the sound of
snow,[<sup>[1]</sup>](#fn1)
you surely don't want to know about my journey from HTML to Haml to
Pug and back to HTML.[<sup>[2]</sup>](#fn2) 

But listen: I've gotten older and more comfortable with just being
one person, and with being seen. My creative
work isn't a liability for my programming; it makes me a better
problem solver. Programming doesn't make me less of
an artist; logic is a tool I can bring to music and improv
(or leave it at home).
  
Anyway, my left brain's had web sites and my right brain's had web
sites, but it's 2019 and I'm just one person, bilateral.
