New site, new blog. I wrote [over on the arts side][arts-brain] about
why my latest web site has an arts side and a code side.

I probably won't
finish the Dropbox Express tutorial (spoiler: generators, then
`await/async`) but expect new posts about what I'm interested in now
(like [Vue][vue], and CSS layout, and fear).
