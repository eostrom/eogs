Quick thoughts on [RubyMine 2019.1][new], which came out earlier this
month but I didn't read the release notes until now:

- [Recent Locations][recent] looks amazing for absent-minded programmers
like me. I'm constantly thinking "OK, go back to that thing I was looking at,
it was about... respondents, I think?" I know what I need to do next,
but I forget what file it's in, so I have to guess, or scan open tabs
and hope something jogs my memory. Now I can press a key to get a display
of *code segments I was actually looking at*, and press more keys to
filter by the text that's in them. Sounds perfect.

- I've been longing for Factory Bot integration for years. It's so easy to
navigate from models to controllers to specs, and then I need to get to
a factory and... nothing. I have to *type in a filename* like some
caveman. Anyway now I can just press a key to get there.
 
- The [Call Hierarchy][calls] view looks like a nice boost for a process that
  can be painfully manual: What calls this method? OK, what calls the
  methods that calls this method? What calls those?

- I love the Ruby debugger but have been frustrated by the JavaScript
debugger, and specifically the console, which until now often printed
results unhelpfully as `Object`. Now it gives you an object tree you
can browse to figure out what's going on. Awesome.
   
- I tried the new [Ruby profiler][profiler] and didn't get it, but next
time I have
to fix a performance problem I will figure it out.
