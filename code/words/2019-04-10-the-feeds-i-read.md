My colleague Eric asked me how I keep up on development trends, so I
made this list of the main RSS feeds I follow (with [Feedly][]/[gReader][]).

## news

- [Vue.js News,](https://news.vuejs.org) because I'm just really into Vue.
  Also available as a podcast. Friends, I read it *and* I listen to it.
  That's how into Vue I am.
- [JavaScript Weekly](https://javascriptweekly.com)  is a big (but not
  too big) list of links every week: articles, announcements, tools,
  tutorials, and job ads.
- [The Changelog](https://changelog.com) covers open source generally.
  I don't read as many
  links from here, but it helps me keep tabs on what the wider developer
  community is talking about. This is the reason I know I should probably
  know what Kubernetes is.
- I wasn't subscribed to [CSS Tricks](http://css-tricks.com/) until
  I made this list, but I seemed to wind up reading a lot of articles from
  there anyway, so now I am.
- Also I just found [Web Platform News](https://webplatform.news/)
  and it looks useful.
  
## views

- [A List Apart](https://alistapart.com) is more design-focused than
  my other reads, and it goes both deep and wide â€“ like this is where
  I read last week about how to support
  [users with vestibular disorders][vestibular].   
- [Sandi Metz](https://www.sandimetz.com) hasn't published a blog post
  in over a year, but I'm still subscribed because I know when she does
  it'll be worth reading and then thinking about until the next one.
- [Avdi Grimm,](https://avdi.codes) like Sandi, is just a smart person who
  thinks
  a lot about how to write better software, or write software better.
  And then, lucky for us, he shares his thoughts.   

What do you read? Just kidding, still getting around to adding comments.
But like I'm on [Twitter][] or whatever.
